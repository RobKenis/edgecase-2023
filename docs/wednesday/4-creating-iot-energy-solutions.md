# Creating IoT Energy Solutions

The idea is to exit grey energy and enter green energy. Currently, the Netherlands uses 40% green energy.

## Main challenges

We need to move from a handful of powerplants to a distributed system of people generating energy at home. This includes the migration from a dumb power grid to a smart grid with more production and
consumption.

Storing energy is way more imporant, since we're dependent on weather for green energy.

## Balancing the energy grid using IoT Edge devices

Primary use case: curtailment. The devices are used for cutting back the capacity of for example solar panels when the energy cannot be stored. This is a transitional solution until we have better
storage in place.

## Proof of Concept

Hardware: Intel NUC. Software: Ubuntu with k3s, basic auth and no update procedure.
