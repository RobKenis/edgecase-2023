# Delivering more Agile, Resilient and Efficient IT

## What happened after the pandemic

Let's take a step back and look at when things were less agile. This was when we built monoliths. They were stable, but very difficult to change. To _fix_ that, we moved to smaller services, containers,
all the cool things to make change easier. This is the result..
