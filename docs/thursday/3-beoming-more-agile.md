# Delivering more Agile, Resilient and Efficient IT

## What happened after the pandemic

After the pandemic, a new normal sets in. New digital services were delivered quickly during the pandemic. Now we need to focus on stabilizing and slowing down. CEO priority shits to stability instead
of growth.

How do we give the leaders confidence? The things we deliver need to be backed up by stable platforms. How can you be resilient, efficient _and_ agile?!

Let's take a step back and look at when things were less agile. This was when we built monoliths. They were stable, but very difficult to change. To _fix_ that, we moved to smaller services, containers,
all the cool things to make change easier. This is the result..

This landscape is driven by "I'll just build it myself". When you build a tool, it's designed for a specific purpose. You have blind spots.

This talk is brought to you by [LogicMonitor](https://www.logicmonitor.com/), a platform built for eliminating blind spots.

## The goals of observability

- Immediate notifications: no emails, but something direct like Slack or Discord or SMS (hello Mr. Dinosaur)
- Answer questions based on observability data: tie tracing and logs and metrics together

LogicMonitor started as an infrastructure platform, it started off in a datacenter. Then the app stack is build on top of it, traces and logs. Then APM is sprinkled on top. _aaaaargh he starts mentioning AI_
All these things combined lead to AIOps, which leverages all your data to pinpoint problems. _Note to self: it's not AI, it's a bunch of if-statements and timestamps_
